# Project Lyzandred

The goal of this project is to learn Unreal Engine 5 basics during the course
`Unreal Engine Developer`. This project will be used to submit tasks and general
practice of development. The end goal is to publish it as addition to my
portfolio.

## Game Overview

Below you can find the basic game concept. Be aware that it may change based on
the timeline, user feedback and what will be needed to practice during the
course.

* **Genre**: 3D platformer with puzzle and combat elements
* **Core Concept**: The player controls three heroes — *Knight*, *Rogue*, and
*Mage* — who are magically bound together and must escape a mad wizard’s
dungeon. Success relies on fluid character switching to combine their unique
abilities across three gameplay pillars:
	* Platforming
	* Simple Combat
	* Environmental puzzles
* **Tone & Style**: Cartoon-like visuals with slightly muted colors,
dark-fantasy dungeon environments occasionally blending into themed biomes 
(forest, tundra, corrupted lands).
